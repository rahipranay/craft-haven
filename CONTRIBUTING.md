## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the [CraftHaven repository](https://github.com/karprabha/shopping-cart) on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the repository from your account to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karprabha/shopping-cart
    ```

3. **Set Up Remote**: To keep your fork up to date with the original repository, add the original repository as a remote. Replace upstream with any name you prefer:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/yourusername/shopping-cart
    ```

4. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Choose a descriptive name for your branch that indicates the feature or bug you're working on:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

## Making Changes

Now you can make changes to the codebase. Whether you're fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving documentation, please follow these guidelines:

-   Write clean and maintainable code.
-   Follow the existing coding style and conventions.
-   Include appropriate comments and documentation.
-   Ensure your changes don't introduce new issues or break existing functionality.
-   Test your changes thoroughly.

## Committing Changes

Please follow best practices for commit messages:

-   Use a clear and concise message that describes your changes.
-   Start the message with a capitalized verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
-   Reference any relevant issue numbers using the # symbol (e.g., "#123").

## Pull Request

When your contribution is ready, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Push Changes**: Commit and push your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
2.  **Create Pull Request**: Visit the original [CraftHaven repository](https://github.com/karprabha/shopping-cart) and click the "New Pull Request" button. Select your branch and provide a brief description of your changes.

3.  **Review Process**: Your PR will undergo a review process by the maintainers. Be prepared to make any necessary revisions based on feedback.

4.  **Approval and Merge**: Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations on your contribution!
